# FrogAPI
A horribly coded Frogger modding tool. Code quality is poor because of how hacky some of the methods (ie: Direct memory manipulation) are the only options.
Code will be improved in the future, as the editor is built.

To any potential employers, please do not use this repository as an indicator of my coding abilities, this project is not up to the standards I would normally hold myself standard to.
